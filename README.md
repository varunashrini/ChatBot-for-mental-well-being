 Chatbot for mental Well being

Firstly, we fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model on the collected data set to classify user messages into different categories based on their intent. Secondly, we integrated the Blenderbot and Dialo-GPT models which were fined-tuned to generate relevant responses based on the predicted context of the user message. Finally, we developed a user-friendly interface that integrates with the built model, enabling users to input their messages and receive responses generated by the fine-tuned models.Firstly, we fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model on the collected data set to classify user messages into different categories based on their intent.
